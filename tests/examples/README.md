### 3. **README.md** (this file)
**Purpose:** Overview and quick start guide

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### For AI Agents

**When a user asks: "Can you investigate why part XYZ is missing from IP&O?"**

1. **Read the guide first:**
   ```bash
   cat tests/examples/AI_AGENT_GUIDE.md
   ```

2. **Copy the template:**
   ```bash
   cp tests/examples/test_template.py dev/investigate_XYZ.py
   ```

3. **Update configuration in the new file:**
   ```python
   COMPANY = "SAINC"
   PART_NUM = "XYZ 123"
   LOCATION = "StoneAge, Inc."
   PERIOD = "2025-08-31"
   EXPECTED_ACTUAL_USAGE = 10
   EXPECTED_IPO_USAGE = 0
   EXPECTED_VARIANCE_CATEGORY = "MISSING_FROM_IPO"
   ```

4. **Run the investigation:**
   ```bash
   python dev/investigate_XYZ.py
   ```

5. **Create investigation report using the output**

## üìñ Investigation Methodology

### The 7-Step Process

**STEP 1: Verify Raw Data Sources**
- Confirm data in PartUsage and IPOValidation tables
- Calculate expected usage values
- Verify against validation results

**STEP 2: Check Part Metadata**
- Review part attributes (NonStock, InActive, ClassID, etc.)
- Evaluate against exclusion criteria
- Determine if part should be filtered

**STEP 3: Analyze Usage History**
- Last 12 months usage pattern
- All-time usage statistics
- Determine if usage is significant or sporadic

**STEP 4: Check IP&O Historical Presence**
- Has part ever been in IP&O?
- When was it last in IP&O?
- Is this a new gap or ongoing issue?

**STEP 5: Evaluate Exclusion Criteria**
- Check current config settings
- Compare part attributes to exclusion rules
- Determine if part should appear in results

**STEP 6: Identify Root Cause**
- Classify issue type:
  - Configuration issue
  - Legitimate missing part
  - Data sync issue
  - Forecasting accuracy issue
- Provide evidence for classification

**STEP 7: Provide Recommendations**
- Immediate actions
- Follow-up actions
- Action owner
- Priority level

## üéØ Root Cause Categories

### Configuration Issue
**Symptoms:** Part meets exclusion criteria, exclusions disabled  
**Action:** Enable exclusions or accept as-is  
**Severity:** Low

### Legitimate Missing Part
**Symptoms:** Stocked part with significant usage, never in IP&O  
**Action:** Add to IP&O system  
**Severity:** Medium-High

### Data Sync Issue
**Symptoms:** Part was in IP&O, stopped appearing, still has usage  
**Action:** Check integration logs  
**Severity:** High

### Forecasting Accuracy Issue
**Symptoms:** Part in both systems, variance in quantities  
**Action:** Review forecast parameters  
**Severity:** Low-Medium

## üìä Example Investigations

See the `dev/` folder for complete examples:

### Example 1: ABX 207 (Configuration Issue)
- **Files:** `dev/investigate_abx207.py`, `dev/INVESTIGATION_FINDINGS.md`
- **Type:** Configuration issue
- **Finding:** NonStock part with low usage, should be excluded
- **Action:** Enable exclusions (optional)

### Example 2: GPT 082 (Legitimate Missing Part)
- **Files:** `dev/investigate_gpt082.py`, `dev/INVESTIGATION_GPT082.md`
- **Type:** Legitimate data integrity issue
- **Finding:** Stocked part with 25 units/year, never in IP&O
- **Action:** Add to IP&O system (required)

## üí° Decision Tree

```
Is exclusions enabled in config?
‚îú‚îÄ NO
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Does part meet any exclusion criteria?
‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí CONFIGURATION ISSUE (enable exclusions)
‚îÇ     ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Continue to next check
‚îî‚îÄ YES
   ‚îî‚îÄ Part is in results (passed exclusions)

Does part have usage in PartUsage?
‚îú‚îÄ NO ‚Üí MISSING_FROM_USAGE (check if part should be in IP&O)
‚îî‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Continue to next check

Does part exist in IPOValidation?
‚îú‚îÄ NO
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Has it EVER been in IPOValidation?
‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ NO ‚Üí LEGITIMATE MISSING PART (add to IP&O)
‚îÇ     ‚îî‚îÄ YES ‚Üí DATA SYNC ISSUE (check integration)
‚îî‚îÄ YES ‚Üí FORECASTING ACCURACY ISSUE (review parameters)
```

## üîç Quick Reference: Exclusion Criteria

| Criterion | Rule | Action if True |
|-----------|------|----------------|
| NonStock | = True | Exclude (non-stocked items) |
| InActive | = True | Exclude (inactive parts) |
| Runout | = True | Exclude (being phased out) |
| ClassID | IN ('RAW', 'CSM') | Exclude (raw materials) |
| Low Usage | ‚â§2 units in 12 months | Exclude (minimal usage) |

**If ANY criterion is true** ‚Üí Part should be excluded from validation

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Resources

### Database Queries
- All queries are in `test_template.py`
- Copy/paste into MCP if needed
- Modify parameters as needed

### MCP Integration
- Can use `mcp_mssql_read_data` tool for queries
- Useful for quick checks without running full script
- Example:
  ```python
  mcp_mssql_read_data(query="SELECT * FROM PartUsage WHERE ...")
  ```

### Configuration
- Check current settings: `cat config.json`
- Key setting: `"apply_exclusions": true/false`
- Affects whether excluded parts appear in results

## ‚úÖ Success Checklist

A complete investigation should answer:

- [ ] Is the variance data accurate?
- [ ] Should this part be excluded from validation?
- [ ] What is the root cause category?
- [ ] What is the business impact?
- [ ] What specific actions should be taken?
- [ ] Who should take action?
- [ ] What is the priority level?
